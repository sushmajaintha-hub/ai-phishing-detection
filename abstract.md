1. Selected Problem Statement : Phishing attacks remain one of the most critical cybersecurity threats in today’s digital ecosystem. Fraudulent emails, messages, and websites deceive users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, banking credentials, and personal data. Despite growing awareness, existing security mechanisms largely depend on user vigilance or static rule-based filters, which are often insufficient against rapidly evolving phishing techniques. There is a pressing need for an intelligent, adaptive, and automated solution that can accurately identify phishing attempts in real time while remaining user-friendly and platform-independent.
2. Proposed Solution Idea : Insight Innovators proposes an AI-Based Phishing Detection System that leverages Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify and classify phishing emails with high accuracy.
The system analyzes email content, subject lines, embedded links, and suspicious keywords to determine whether an email is Phishing or Safe.
The solution is designed as a lightweight web-based application that allows users to paste or upload email content. Upon analysis, the system provides an instant prediction along with confidence scores and highlights potentially malicious indicators such as urgency-driven language, deceptive URLs, and spoofed sender patterns. This approach ensures proactive threat detection while minimizing user effort.
